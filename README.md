# Case Description

Overview: Our Customer Engagement Analysis with SQL and Tableau project offers an exceptional opportunity to enhance and expand your professional portfolio. Your task is to build a three-page dashboard including key metrics and visualizations that aims to show student engagement with the 365 platform and identify critical areas of improvement. 

Objective: The following is a list of the questions we want our dashboard to answer:

- Which courses are the most watched by students, and how are they rated?
- How many students register each month, and what fraction are also onboarded?
- How do students engage with the platform (minutes and average minutes watched) based on student type (free-plan or paying)?
- Do students watch more content with time, and does it vary seasonally?
- Which countries have the most students registered, and does this number scale proportionally with the number of minutes watched per country?
- Discuss your findings, uncover valuable insights, and gain meaningful experience working on a real-life database.
